These mini-projects are just case-studies of what Ruby is capable to do.

PLEASE NOTE: I'm not, by any means, asking you to use these codes in your application. In
truth, if I can say anything, is DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR PROJECTS! This is just a case
study, and it's not intended to be used in anything, ESPECIALLY in production-ready softwares!
